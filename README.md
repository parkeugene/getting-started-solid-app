This is a tutorial for an introductory application that uses Inrupt's javascript libraries to interact with a Solid Pod. 
The application is a simple reading list that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. 
The application is built using Next.js and the Tailwindcss framework.

## Prerequisites

- Install Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)
- Get a WebID from a Solid Pod provider (e.g., [Inrupt's PodSpaces](https://docs.inrupt.com/pod-spaces))

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
